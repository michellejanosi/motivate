02: Inspiration

03: Feeling Down

04: Unconfident

Quotes are sorted by numerical ID, to make a quote make a file with the next number.
There must be the same amount of quotes in the 'quotes' directories and the categories in the quotes directory.
The range of max quotes set by the program is set in 'main' by the QUOTES_AMOUNT variable. Change it to the amount of quotes in all the quote directories.

##### Rules for making quotes

- Quotes must be appropriate for the category.
- Quote files cannot contain double quotes, all double quotes must be replaced with apostrophe's
- Apostrophes must not be used except for the beginning and end of quotes. Rewrite words such as I'm to I am.
- Dashes cannot be used in quotes. ex. - Albert Einstein.  cannot be used .
- If the quote is from a person other than you, it must be contained between apostrophe's then split by a TAB then the original author without a dash.
- If the quote is your own, you write the quote without apostrophe's or author. It will be considered part of Motivate.
- If the author is not you and unknown, the author is 'Unknown' (DUH)
